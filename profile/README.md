# The Unified Daughterboard Project

## Introduction
The Unified Daughterboard Project is an attempt by leading designers in the mechanical keyboard community to standardize the USB daughterboards used for their custom mechanical keyboard projects.  

The main characteristic of this daughterboard is to integrate a USB Type C connector and the needed circuitry for USB2.0 operation in a small PCB that can be screwed to a keyboard chassis; this significantly simplifies the assembly and design of the main circuit board.

## Features

In its latest versions, the daughterboards of this project feature:

* ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection on the data lines of the USB connector through a specialized chip;
* Overcurrent protection through a PTC fuse;
* Overvoltage protection through a bidirectional TVS diode;
* Shielding noise decoupling capabilities through a ferrite bead;
* Single-path grounding of the metallic chassis to which the daughterboard is attached.

Adittionally, same-letter series (C1, C2, C3, etc.) are backwards compatible, allowing for upgrading daughterboards used in past projects to newer revisions.
